;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `agent-shell-chat-mode' relabels the shell so it reads like a chat:
;; each submitted user turn is boxed `Me' and each response is boxed with
;; the agent's name.  Labels are overlays, so the buffer text is untouched
;; (a `display' overlay replaces the visible comint prompt for `Me', and a
;; `before-string' overlay renders the agent label at the invisible
;; `<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>' marker).
;;
;; The live prompt awaiting input shows `Me' too, so you can type straight
;; into the shell.  When `agent-shell-prompt-bar-mode' is enabled, input
;; flows through that bar instead, so the live prompt is hidden.
;;
;; Toggle it with `M-x agent-shell-chat-mode'.

Input is bounded by the next prompt, not just the
`<shell-maker-end-of-prompt>' marker (which only appears once a response
starts): `Me' shows the instant a prompt is submitted, and an empty
prompt does not claim the fresh prompt below as its input.

Blank lines around the prompt collapse to exactly one on each side.  The
label rides the one above rather than covering it, so that nothing is
shown at the prompt itself, and the marker travels as a `line-prefix':
